    201. Write a Java program to divide a given array of integers into given k non-empty subsets whose sums are all equal. Return true if all sums are equal otherwise return false. Go to the editor

Example:
nums = {1,3,3,5,6,6}, k = 4;
4 subsets (5,1), (3, 3), (6), (6) with equal sums.

Expected Output:

Original Array: [1, 3, 3, 5, 6, 6]
Target of subsets: 4
After removing duplicate characters: true

202. Write a Java program to find the total number of continuous subarrays in a given array of integers whose sum equals to an given integer. Go to the editor

Expected Output:

Original Array: [4, 2, 3, 3, 7, 2, 4]
Value of k: 6
Total number of continuous subarrays: 3

203. Write a Java program to find the contiguous subarray of given length k which has the maximum average value of a given array of integers. Display the maximum average value. Go to the editor

Expected Output:

Original Array: [4, 2, 3, 3, 7, 2, 4]
Value of k: 3
Maximum average value: 4.333333333333333

204. Write a Java program to compute xn % y where x, y and n are all 32bit integers. Go to the editor

Expected Output:

Input x :  25
Input n :  35
Input y :  45
x^n % y = 5.0

205. Write a Java program to check whether an given integer is power of 2 or not using O(1) time. Go to the editor

Note: O(1) means that it takes a constant time, like 12 nanoseconds, or two minutes no matter the amount of data in the set.
O(n) means it takes an amount of time linear with the size of the set, so a set twice the size will take twice the time. You probably don't want to put a million objects into one of these.

Expected Output:

Input a number :  25
false

206. Write a Java program to find all unique combinations from a collection of candidate numbers. The sum of the numbers will be equal to a given target number. Go to the editor

Expected Output:

Input number of elements of the array:
 3
Input number format: 2 3 4 5:
Enter elements:
 6 7 8
Enter target sum:
 21
A solution set is:
{ 6 7 8 }

207. Write a Java program to merge two sorted (ascending) linked lists in ascending order. Go to the editor

Expected Output:

How many elements do you want to add in 1st linked list?:  3
Input numbers of 1st linked list in ascending order:  1 2 3

How many elements do you want to add in 2nd linked list?:  3
Input numbers of 2nd linked list in ascending order:  4 5 6

Merged list: 1 2 3 4 5 6

208. Write a Java program to create a basic string compression method using the counts of repeated characters. Go to the editor

Input string: aaaabbbbcccccddddeeee

Expected Output:

Enter a string (you can include space as well)
 aaaabbbbcccccddddeeee
The compressed string along with the counts of repeated characters is:
a4b4c5d4e4

209. Write a Java program to find all unique combinations from a collection of candidate numbers. The sum of the numbers will be equal to a given target number. Go to the editor

Input number of elements of the array:
3
Input number format: 2 3 4 5:

Expected Output:

Enter elements:
 6 7 8
Enter target sum:
 21
A solution set is:
{ 6 7 8 }

210. Write a Java program to match any single character (use ?) or any sequence of characters use *) including the empty. The matching should cover the entire input string. Go to the editor

Expected Output:

Enter a string
 bb
Enter a pattern
 b*
Yes
