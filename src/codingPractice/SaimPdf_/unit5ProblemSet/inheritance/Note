Inheritance is a very important and popular concept in OOP.

What is Inheritance?
The keyword extends is used to make a class inherits data and behaviors of another class.This is called Inheritance
           Ex: public Truck extends Car {
           }

Note:Only public and protected members of the superclass are inherited by the subclass.

Why is Inheritance?

-Inheritance is for reusing code.
-inheritance is for the purpose of extensibility.

How is Inheritance implemented in Java?
       Inheritance can be implemented in three ways:
NOTE:A final class is a class that can't be extended.
1.A class inherits another class.The keyword extends is used
          EXAMPLE:
                public class Person { }

                public class Deisnger extends Person { }

                public class Programmer extends Person { }

                public class Architect extends Programmer { }

2.A class implements another interface. The keyword implements is used.
                EXAMPLE:
                public interface Wearable { }

                public class Shirt implements Wearable { }

                public class Glass implements Wearable { }

3.An interface inherits another interface. The keyword extends is used.
                EXAMPLE:
                public interface Collection { }

                public interface List extends Collection { }

                public interface Set extends Collection { }
