/*
In the Eskimo language nanuk means polar bear. When the tribe men goes hunting they need to select a leader, each men boasts on how many fish, elk or other animals he can hunt.

Then they vote who will lead them.

A successful hunt for the leader is when they managed to hunt as much as he boasted and the hunting party managed to avoid a polar bear (nanuk) which can ruin a whole hunt.

Experienced hunters know of ways in the terrain to avoid polar bears, they use way stones to mark these areas.

The method nanuk has an ArrayList r which represents what the hunters found during the hunt. Tt can be a number of successful catches or the word "nanuk".

The int way_stones is the amount of way stones the leader knows to help him avoid nanuks. Each way stone will help avoid one nanuk

The int boast is the number representing the party leaders boast, if he gets less then this the hunt is considered "doomed".

return true if hunters had enough way_stones to avoid all nanuks. And they returned with successful hunt catches which should be more or equal to how many leader boasted before the hunt.
return false if hunters encountered nanuk but did not have a way_stone to avoid it, or catches were less than boast count.
Example:

nanuk(["1","2","3","5"],0,5)

returns true
(no nanuks, and catches are 11 which is more than 5 that leader boasted)

nanuk(["1","nanuk","3","5"],0,5)

returns false
(They encountered nanuk but had 0 waystones)

nanuk(["1","3"],0,5)

returns false

nanuk(["1","10","3","nanuk"],2,7)

returns true

nanuk(["1","10","3","nanuk","nanuk"],2,7)

returns true

nanuk(["1","10","3","nanuk","nanuk","nanuk"],2,7)

returns false

hint: use Integer.parseInt() to convert string to int, if its not a nanuk add the number to a "points" int and compare it to the boast after the loop is over.

if it is a nanuk and waypoints is bigger then 0 ignore the nanuk and reduce the number of waypoints.
