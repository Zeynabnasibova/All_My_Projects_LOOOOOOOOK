    2 String variables are already declared and assigned values.

They will hold different topics we will learn.

Using those variables print the message exactly like below.

Ex:

Assume topic1 = "Java" and topic2 = "SQL"

You need to print exactly:

I will learn "Java" and "SQL" at CybertekSchool.
