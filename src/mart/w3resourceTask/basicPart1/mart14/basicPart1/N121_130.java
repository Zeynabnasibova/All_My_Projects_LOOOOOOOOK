    121. Write a Java program to reverse a given linked list. Go to the editor
Example: For linked list 20->40->60->80, the reversed linked list is 80->60->40->20 Click me to see the solution

122. Write a Java program to find a contiguous subarray with largest sum from a given array of integers. Go to the editor
Note: In computer science, the maximum subarray problem is the task of finding the contiguous subarray within a one-dimensional array of numbers which has the largest sum. For example, for the sequence of values −2, 1, −3, 4, −1, 2, 1, −5, 4; the contiguous subarray with the largest sum is 4, −1, 2, 1, with sum 6. The subarray should contain one integer at least.

124. Write a Java program to find the index of a value in a sorted array. If the value does not find return the index where it would be if it were inserted in order. Go to the editor
Example:
[1, 2, 4, 5, 6] 5(target) -> 3(index)
[1, 2, 4, 5, 6] 0(target) -> 0(index)
[1, 2, 4, 5, 6] 7(target) -> 5(index)
