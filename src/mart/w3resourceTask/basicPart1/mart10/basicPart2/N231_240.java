233. Write a Java program that accept a even number (n should be greater than or equal to 4 and less than or equal to 50,000, Goldbach number) from the user and create a combinations that express the given number as a sum of two prime numbers. Print the number of combinations. Go to the editor

Goldbach number: A Goldbach number is a positive even integer that can be expressed as the sum of two odd primes.[4] Since four is the only even number greater than two that requires the even prime 2 in order to be written as the sum of two primes, another form of the statement of Goldbach's conjecture is that all even integers greater than 4 are Goldbach numbers.
The expression of a given even number as a sum of two primes is called a Goldbach partition of that number. The following are examples of Goldbach partitions for some even numbers:
6 = 3 + 3
8 = 3 + 5
10 = 3 + 7 = 5 + 5
12 = 7 + 5
...
100 = 3 + 97 = 11 + 89 = 17 + 83 = 29 + 71 = 41 + 59 = 47 + 53

Sample Output:

Input an even number: 100

Number of combinations: 6

237. There are 10 vertical and horizontal squares on a plane. Each square is painted blue and green. Blue represents the sea, and green represents the land. When two green squares are in contact with the top and bottom, or right and left, they are said to be ground. The area created by only one green square is called "island". For example, there are five islands in the figure below.
Write a Java program to read the mass data and find the number of islands. Go to the editor

Input:
A single data set is represented by 10 rows of 10 numbers representing green squares as 1 and blue squares as zeros.
Output: For each data set, output the number of islands.

Sample Output:

Input 10 rows of 10 numbers representing green squares (island) as 1 and blue squares (sea) as zeros

238. When character are consecutive in a string , it is possible to shorten the character string by replacing the character with a certain rule. For example, in the case of the character string YYYYY, if it is expressed as # 5 Y, it is compressed by one character.
Write a Java program to restore the original string by entering the compressed string with this rule. However, the # character does not appear in the restored character string. Go to the editor
Note: The original sentences are uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, symbols, less than 100 letters, and consecutive letters are not more than 9 letters.

Input:
Multiple character strings are given. One string is given per line.
Output: The restored character string for each character on one line.

Sample Output:

Input the text:
XY#6Z1#4023
XYZZZZZZ1000023
