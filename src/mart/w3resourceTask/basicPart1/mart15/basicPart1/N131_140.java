134. Write a Java program to find the distinct ways you can climb to the top (n steps to reach to the top) of stairs. Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. Go to the editor
Example: n = 5
a) 1+1+1+1+1 = 5 b) 1+1+1+2 = 5 c) 1+2+2 = 5 d) 2+2+1 = 5 e) 2+1+1+1 = 5 f) 2+1+2 = 5 g) 1+2+1+1 = 5 h) 1+1+2+1 = 5
Sample Output: Distinct ways can you climb to the top: 8

136. Write a Java program to find possible unique paths from top-left corner to bottom-right corner of a given grid (m x n). Go to the editor
Note: You can move either down or right at any point in time.
Sample Output: Unique paths from top-left corner to bottom-right corner of the said grid: 3

137. Write a Java program to find possible unique paths considering some obstacles, from top-left corner to bottom-right corner of a given grid (m x n). Go to the editor
Note: You can move either down or right at any point in time and an obstacle and empty space is marked as 1 and 0 respectively in the grid.
Sample grid:
int[][] obstacle_Grid ={
{0, 0, 0},
{0, 1, 0},
{0, 0, 0},
};
Sample Output: Unique paths from top-left corner to bottom-right corner of the said grid (considering some obstacles): 2
