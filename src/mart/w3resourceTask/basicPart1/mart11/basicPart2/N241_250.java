244. Write a Java program which accepts a string from the user and check whether the string is correct or not. Go to the editor

The conditions for getting the "correct answer" are:
a) There must be only three characters X, Y, and Z in the string, and no other characters.
b) Any string of any form such as aXYZa can get the "correct answer", where a is either an empty string or a string consisting only of the letter X;
c) If aXbZc is correct, aXbYZca is also correct, where a, b, c are either empty strings or a string consisting only of the letter X.

Input:

Input a string:
 XYZ
Correct format..

249. From Wikipedia,
The Hamming weight of a string is the number of symbols that are different from the zero-symbol of the alphabet used. It is thus equivalent to the Hamming distance from the all-zero string of the same length. For the most typical case, a string of bits, this is the number of 1's in the string, or the digit sum of the binary representation of a given number and the ℓ₁ norm of a bit vector. In this binary case, it is also called the population count, popcount, sideways sum, or bit summation.

Example:

String	Hamming weight
11101	4
11101000	4
00000000	0
789012340567	10

250. From Wikipedia,
A cyclic redundancy check (CRC) is an error-detecting code commonly used in digital networks and storage devices to detect accidental changes to raw data. Blocks of data entering these systems get a short check value attached, based on the remainder of a polynomial division of their contents. On retrieval, the calculation is repeated and, in the event the check values do not match, corrective action can be taken against data corruption. CRCs can be used for error correction.

Example:

Write a Java program to generate a crc32 checksum of a given string or byte array. Go to the editor
Input:

Input a string:  The quick brown fox
crc32 checksum of the string: b74574de
