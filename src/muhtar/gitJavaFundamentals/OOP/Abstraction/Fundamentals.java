		/* Abstraction: hides the implementation. instead of focusing on how it's done,focuses on what it is.
		 				1. abstract method: HAS to be created in abstract class or in interface.
		 				2. abstract method: cannot have body and meant to be overridden.
		 				3. abstract methods: cannot have body, cannot be private or static or final.
		 				4. constructor method cannot be abstract
		 				5. abstract class and interface cannot be object type. they can only be reference type.
		 				6. in interface, all none static methods by default is abstract method
		 				7. in interface, we can only have regular static methods( not private and not final) and abstract method.
		 				8. abstract class can have abstract method and any other methods.
		 				9. abstract class can automatically inherit the abstract methods
		 				10. when abstract class is reference we can only give regular child class for the object type
						11. instance variables in interface by default are final.
						12. when interface is reference we can only give REGULAR implements class for object type.
